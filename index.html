	<h3>How to Play</h3>
		R: rool the dice <br/>
		LEFT CLICK: place settlement <br/>
		<br/>
		With each roll of the dice you will collect the resources associated with the rolled dice value. <br/>
		Your resources are stored in an array which is displayed in the gui node. <br/>
		If you roll a 7, the robber takes all your resources. <br/>
		You win by building a settlement which means collecting: lumber, sheep, brick, and wheat and placing in it desired location.<br/>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is to make a 3D version of the settlers of Catan board game. To win in this game you must be the first player to achieve 10 victory points. You get 1 victory point for building a settlement, 2 for a city and 2 for longest road and largest army.  In Settlers of Catan you build settlements and cities with resources you earn. You earn resources by owning settlements on the hexes with respective die values, rolling the die, and collecting the resource associated with each hex. In my game, there needs to be 3D dice that get rolled randomly, a function that randomizes the board, the ability to have two players to play against each other, a way to keep track of resources, and a system that allows a player to click and build 3D settlements and cities on the game board if they have the correct resources. The GUI node can be used to indicate which player’s turn it is each time. The goal is to make a 3D version of the settlers of Catan board game.

<h3> Game Elements </h3>
<h4> Scene Graph & Hierarchical transformations </h4>
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Current node hierarchy of the game consists of 7 nodes: the board, the hexes, the settlements, the models, the roads, the dice and the landscape. The models and roads are attached to the settlement node, the settlement node it attached to the board node. The hexes are also attached to the board node, and the board node is attached to the root node. The game board is composed of 19 hexagons and each hexagon is composed of 6 custom mesh triangles. The dice hover above the game board and roll when the “r” key is pressed. The board in set within the larger scene of the island landscape. The function that creates all the hexagons in the make hexagons function which consists of over 700 lines of code because you have to make 19*6 triangle geometries and then rotate and set a material for each of them. I intend to write a class that will create geometries and cut down on the code length. The different colors of each hex will represent different resources: wheat, bricks, lumber, ore, sheep, and the desert. In the future the plan is to replace the hex colors with textures that represent the resource. 
</div>
<br/>
<h4> Asset Manager</h4> 

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, the asset manager uses a couple of models I created to look like settlements and loads them into the game. I use trigonometry to know where to place the settlements. The goal will be to make each point of the hexagon a coordinate at which a player can place a settlement by clicking on it. There will be functions that check for the distance rule (make sure settlements aren’t too close to each other) and that the player has the resources necessary to build a settlement. 
</div>
<br/>
<h4> Animation & Light</h4> 

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AnimControl and Animal Channels have not yet been explicitly implemented but my game does have an animation of die rotating at the top of the screen. It uses a skeleton and the simple update method to keep rotating. I have begun to use the guiNode to display the distance of how far the fly cam has moved (even though I intend to disable the flycam) and a graphic that represents player1. Ambient light is used on the die to make them have more of a brighter glow. The models use directional light to display a shadow. The settlements are models but the road is still a geometry and is not affected by light. I created my own die material using the JMonkey built in material creator. I loaded my die texture which is just a png image. A DiffuseMap is enabled in the material creator which causes the texture to appear as is.
</div>
<br/>
<h4> Input Mapping</h4> 

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the makeHexagons function there is also a makeRoads, makeModels, makeDice, and makeGUInode function. In the SimpleInit() function in the main, contains code for user input from last assignment. I declared the trigger and map variables as final static variables. I wanted to create a different trigger for each of the settlements created so far. Since I wanted an action to be performed on the settlements those variables also had to be declared outside the SimpleInit() function. At the end of the SimpleInit() function, the input manager declarations were made for mapping and for listeners. Then an action listener class had to be created which listens for input from the keys declared by the triggers earlier: the x, c, v keys. I wanted for each key I assigned to a trigger to change the color of one settlement, but each button changes the color of every settlement. I haven’t figured out how to separate these functions yet.
</div>
<br/>
<h4> Landscape & Terrain</h4> 

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my landscape I used the TestPostWater class from JME tests because I could kill 4 birds with one stone. Firstly because it is a landscape, secondly it contains an animated ocean, thirdly it has ambient and positional sound, fourthly I had intended from the beginning to have my board placed above a body of water, just as it is in the original board game. The landscape uses textures and terrains, as well as a diffuse map for lighting. The water graphics and sound use the update class to continue changing appearance and sound base on time and position. You can heard the positional sound of the water by navigating through the scene with the flycam, going underwater or above the mountains (even though I intend to disable the flycam).
</div>
<br/>	
<h4> Ambient & Interactive Sound</h4> 
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also added a sound effect for adding roads and settlements to the board. The goal is that you will be able to use Ray Collision to click on part of the board to add a model. Currently when you left click it changes a road color and makes a sound. The sound is a one second mono WAV file of an African Water Drum.
