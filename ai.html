          <h3>Artificially Intelligent Tic Tac Toe C++ </h3><br/>
          Spring 2015 <br/><br/>

          Tic-tac-toe can be played on a general nrRows x nrCols board where a player wins by having nrToWin of its 
          elements consecutively in a row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal. The traditional tic-tac-toe corresponds to 
          the case where nrRows = nrCols = nrToWin = 3. This project, implements an evaluation function for the general 
          tic-tac-toe game. <br/> <br/>
          
          The interface is: nrRows   nrCols   nrToWin   player1Type   player2Type  <br/> <br/>
          
          Where player1Type is a string corresponding to either ‘human’ or ‘AI’ and player2Type is a string 
          corresponding to either ‘human’ or ‘AI’. <br/> <br/>
          
          The program displays the board each move, if human it prompts the user for input, if AI the program will
          automatically make its move based on the Evaluation Function. <br/> <br/>
          
          On a 3x3 board, the program never loses. In fact, the program will never lose when nrRows = nrCols = nrToWin. <br/><br/>

          <h3>Artificially Intelligent Maze Solver Java </h3><br/>
          Spring 2015 <br/><br/>
          1) <b>Maze Generation</b><br/>

	The program takes the following arguments from the command line: <br/><br/>
	
	nrRows   nrCols   maze.txt<br/><br/>
	
	Where nrRows is the number of rows, nrCols is the number of columns, and maze.txt is the name of
	the output file. The program generates random maze details which are written to the file maze.txt. 
	The format of the output file is as follows: <br/><br/>
	
	- First line contains the number of rows and the number of columns<br/>
	- Second line contains the number of remaining lines in the file<br/>
	- Each line from the third to the last contains the row index, the column index, and a string 
	describing which walls are up (the line 2 3 LRU indicates that the cell in row 2 and column 3 has the left, 
	right, and up walls).<br/>
	- L for the left wall<br/>
	- R for the right wall<br/>
	- U for the up wall<br/>
	- D for the down wall<br/><br/><br/>
	
	
	2) <b>Maze Search</b><br/>
	
	The program takes the following arguments from the command line:<br/>
	
	method   maze.txt   rstart   cstart   rend   cend   path.txt<br/><br/>
	
	Where method is the name of the search method, maze.txt is the name of the file with the maze details, 
	rstart is the row index of the start position, cstart is the column index of the start position, rend is 
	the row index of the end position, cend is the column index of the end position.<br/><br/>
	
	The method name is as follows: DFS for depth-first search or BFS for breadth-first search.
	The program reads the file maze.txt and searches for a solution from (rstart, cstart) to
	(rend, cend). It then writes the solution to the file path.txt. The format of the output file
	is as follows:<br/><br/>
	
	- first line contains the number of elements in the path<br/>
	- each line from the second to the last contains the row index and the column index of the i-th cell in
	the path<br/><br/>
	
	The text files are then translated by a function which outputs the maze and path to a GUI.<br/><br/>
