      	<h2>The Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Interactive Hallway Display project</h2> <br/>
      	Group members: Ali Gillis, Max Huddleston, Meshari Alluqomani, Tho Vi. <br/><br/>
      	<b>Abstract</b> – Our project aims to create an interactive display for the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department at The Catholic University of America in order to make it more welcoming as well as showcase student and faculty projects more easily. Design setup is accomplished by encasing a large screen, a computer, and a Kinect in a display on the second floor of Pangborn Hall. This project is divided into two main tasks: (1) Make the screen interactive by connecting it with a portable computer and a Windows Kinect camera that interprets user gestures wirelessly, and (2) create a user-friendly application that contains information from the EECS website and other locations. All information is updated through files stored in Dropbox and controlled by the EECS office. Small games are included to make the display beyond simply informational. The Kinect camera is programmed to recognize a user’s hand, replacing mouse input while emitting equivalent hardware events, enabling the user to remotely control the display in a manner transparent to the OS. The programming for the Kinect is accomplished using the Kinect open source API and C#; the user friendly application is written using JavaFX Scene Builder to aid in the GUI creation and Java for the back end functions. <br/>

	    <b>Requirements</b><br/><br/>
	    
		<ul>
		<li>We will have a 50 inch monitor inside the glass display case on the second floor of The Engineering 
		Building across from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science office and create custom software to 
		display</li>
		<li>Department Information</li>
		<li>Department Events & Announcements</li>
		<li>Faculty Research</li>
		<li>Faculty Information</li>
		<li>Student Projects</li>
		<li>Games</li>
		<li>Users will interact with the display using the Xbox Kinect for Windows</li>
		<li>You are able to stand up to 10 feet away and the Kinect will recognize your hand as the mouse</li>
		<li>Computer Science Students: Max & Ali</li>
		<li>Design Software user interface</li>
		<li>Write back end functions</li>
		<li>Manipulate Windows Settings</li>
		<li>Create Dropbox folder architecture to store files and images to display</li>
		<li>Electrical Engineering Students: Tho & Meshari</li>
		<li>Implement Windows Kinect to be used as a mouse</li>
		<li>Write functions to ensure that only one user is active at a time, one can only interact with the 
		screen if hand is above elbow, anyone of any height can use easily the same, and be able to grab scroll bar.</li>
		<li>Put interactive games on display</li>
		</ul>
